## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### For Developers

**Use centralized configuration:**

// Instead of hardcoding routes
import { ROUTES, API_ENDPOINTS } from '@/config/paths.js';

// Use configured values
<Link href={ROUTES.CITIZEN_DASHBOARD}>...</Link>
fetch(API_ENDPOINTS.GET_REPORTS)
```

**Use API helpers:**

// Instead of raw fetch calls
import { createReport, getMyReports } from '@/utils/api.js';

const response = await createReport(reportData);
const myReports = await getMyReports();


**Environment variables:**
- Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to switch between dev/prod APIs
- Check `.env.local` for frontend configuration
- Check `server/.env` for backend configuration

### For DevOps

**Database optimization:**
- Regular backups: `pg_dump stray_shield > backup.sql`
- Index optimization: Run `VACUUM ANALYZE;` weekly
- Monitor slow queries with PostgreSQL logs

**Performance monitoring:**
- Use Railway/Render logs for backend monitoring
- Use Vercel Analytics for frontend performance
- Set up alerts for errors (1% error rate threshold)

**Scaling preparation:**
- Database connection pooling ready
- CDN-ready static asset structure
- Load balancer compatible backend

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Design

### Design Philosophy
- **Glassmorphism**: Modern frosted glass effect
- **Dynamic Colors**: OKLCH color palette for smooth gradients
- **Animations**: Framer Motion with spring physics
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- **Mobile First**: Optimized for all screen sizes

### Key UI Components
- **Navbar**: Sticky frosted-glass pane with smooth animations
- **Buttons**: Interactive hover effects with smooth transitions
- **Forms**: Validated input with helpful error messages
- **Cards**: Responsive grid with hover animations
- **Modals**: Smooth entrance/exit animations

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Frontend Issues

**Port 3000 already in use:**
```bash
# Find and kill process
lsof -i :3000 | grep LISTEN | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
```

**API not responding:**
- Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `.env.local`
- Ensure backend is running on port 3001
- Check CORS settings in backend

**Authentication failing:**
- Clear localStorage: DevTools → Application → Storage → Clear All
- Login again to get fresh token

### Backend Issues

**ECONNREFUSED on startup:**
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running (if using database)
- Check `server/.env` for correct database URL
- Use file-based storage by default

**JWT token invalid:**
- Verify `JWT_SECRET` matches between frontend and backend
- Check token expiration (24 hours)
- Regenerate token by logging in again

**Database connection failing:**
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running: `brew services start postgresql`
- Verify credentials in `.env`
- Check database exists: `psql -U postgres -l`
